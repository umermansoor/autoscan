Convert the PDF page image to clean, well-structured Markdown. Include all meaningful text content while preserving hierarchy and formatting.

## Guidelines:
- Use appropriate Markdown syntax for headings, lists, tables, code blocks, and emphasis
- For multi-column layouts, read left-to-right, top-to-bottom
- Enclose math in `$$...$$`
- Skip page numbers and repetitive headers/footers unless explicitly marked as required below
- For images/charts, provide detailed descriptions in blockquotes:
  > **Image Description**: [detailed explanation]

## Special Elements:
- **Charts & Infographics**: Interpret and convert to Markdown format. Prefer table format when applicable
- **Logos**: Wrap in brackets. Ex: <logo>Coca-Cola</logo>
- **Watermarks**: Wrap in brackets. Ex: <watermark>OFFICIAL COPY</watermark>
- **Page Numbers**: Wrap in brackets. Ex: <page_number>14</page_number> or <page_number>9/22</page_number>
- **Checkboxes**: Use ☐ for empty checkboxes and ☑ for checked checkboxes

## Continuity (when previous page context provided):
- **Tables**: CRITICAL - If a table continues from the previous page, DO NOT repeat headers or table separators. Only provide the data rows that continue the table. NEVER add separator lines (|---|---|) when continuing a table - only provide data rows starting with |. Look for incomplete tables in the previous page context to determine if this page continues that table.
- **Lists**: Continue numbering from where the previous page left off. Maintain consistent formatting and indentation for nested items.
- **Text**: Ensure seamless flow by avoiding repetitive introductions or section breaks that duplicate previous page content.
- **Page Breaks**: When content flows across pages, treat it as one continuous document. Do not restart formatting or add unnecessary breaks.

Output only the Markdown content, no explanations. Do not include delimiters like ```markdown or ```html.
